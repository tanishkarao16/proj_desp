The Frontend Portfolio Trilogy: Technical Blueprints

Project 1: Lumina — Strategic Wealth & Asset OS

Focus: Data Visualisation, Performance, and Premium UI/UX.
Estimated Cost: 0 Yen (Zero-Cost Stack).

Detailed Features

Net Worth Engine: Real-time calculation of portfolio value across diverse asset classes (Stocks, Crypto, Cash).

Glassmorphism UI: A high-end dark theme using backdrop-blur, thin borders, and Geist typography.

Privacy Mode: A global state toggle that blurs all sensitive financial data using a CSS filter.

Optimistic Trading: Instant UI feedback when adding/removing assets using React useOptimistic.

Development Phases

Phase 1: Secure Infrastructure (8h): Setup Next.js 14, Clerk Auth, and Prisma/Neon DB schema.

Phase 2: The Design System (12h): Build the responsive sidebar, glass-cards, and custom Tailwind configuration.

Phase 3: The Ledger & CRUD (15h): Implement Server Actions for asset management and real-time data fetching.

Phase 4: Motion & Command (15h): Add Framer Motion staggered transitions and the CMD+K search palette.

Phase 5: Performance Tuning (10h): 100/100 Lighthouse audit, image optimization, and edge deployment.

Project 2: Aether — Collaborative Spatial Audio Lab

Focus: Real-time APIs, Web Audio, and Multiplayer Sync.
Estimated Cost: 0 Yen (Zero-Cost Stack).

Detailed Features

Spatial Audio Engine: A 2D grid where distance between the "Listener" and "Source" icons controls volume and stereo panning.

Multiplayer Presence: See other users' cursors and their sound node adjustments in real-time.

Frequency Visualizers: High-performance Canvas-based waves that react to the audio's bit-stream.

BPM Sync: A shared clock that keeps all audio nodes playing in time across different users.

Development Phases

Phase 1: Web Audio Base (10h): Connect AudioContext, create oscillator nodes, and handle basic play/stop logic.

Phase 2: Spatial Mapping (12h): Calculate distance formulas (Pythagorean theorem) to map UI (x, y) coordinates to Audio Panner nodes.

Phase 3: Multiplayer Sync (15h): Integrate Liveblocks to sync the position of every icon on the grid for all users.

Phase 4: Visualizer Lab (15h): Use AnalyserNode to pull real-time frequency data into a 60FPS HTML5 Canvas loop.

Phase 5: UX Refinement (8h): Add neon-glow aesthetics and mobile-touch support for dragging nodes.

Project 3: Vertex — AI-Architectural 3D Visualizer

Focus: WebGL (3D), Generative AI, and Spatial Logic.
Estimated Cost: 0 Yen (Zero-Cost Stack).

Detailed Features

Natural Language to 3D: Enter "A modern room with a red chair" and watch the 3D scene build itself.

Interactive Viewport: A full WebGL canvas where users can rotate, zoom, and click on 3D objects to edit them.

Dynamic Lighting: Real-time shadows, point lights, and environment mapping (HDRI).

Procedural Layout: An algorithm that prevents 3D meshes from overlapping when the AI generates a room.

Development Phases

Phase 1: WebGL Foundation (10h): Setup React Three Fiber (R3F), a basic scene, a floor, and orbit controls.

Phase 2: Asset Pipeline (12h): Build a library of GLTF/GLB models (chairs, tables) and a system to load them dynamically.

Phase 3: AI Parser (15h): Use the Gemini API to turn user text into a JSON map of objects and coordinates.

Phase 4: Interaction System (15h): Implement ray-casting so users can click 3D objects to change their color or position.

Phase 5: Post-Processing (8h): Add bloom effects, soft shadows, and a "Blueprint" mode toggle for an architectural feel.

Zero-Cost Infrastructure Guide

All projects utilize "Developer First" platforms that offer generous free tiers:

Hosting: Vercel (Free for personal projects with CI/CD).

Database: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless, free tier includes 512MB storage and generous compute).

Authentication: Clerk (Free up to 10,000 monthly active users).

AI (Vertex): Google AI Studio / Gemini API (Free tier allows enough RPM for a personal portfolio).

Multiplayer (Aether): Liveblocks (Free tier supports up to 100 simultaneous connections).

Assets: Use Lucide React for icons and Poly Haven or Market64 for free 3D GLTF models.
